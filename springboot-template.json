      "title": "What is Spring Boot?",
      "content": "Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring ecosystem that simplifies the development of Java applications. It eliminates boilerplate configuration by providing sensible defaults, embedded servers, and opinionated setup. This allows developers to focus more on business logic rather than infrastructure and configuration."
    },
    {
      "title": "Why Use Spring Boot?",
      "content": "Spring Boot helps developers create stand-alone, production-ready applications quickly. It provides embedded servers like Tomcat, automatic dependency management, and seamless integration with databases and cloud platforms. These features make it ideal for microservices and modern backend development."
    },
    {
      "title": "Creating a Spring Boot Application",
      "content": "A Spring Boot application starts with a main class annotated with @SpringBootApplication. This annotation enables auto-configuration, component scanning, and configuration support.",
      "codeExample": "import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\n\n@SpringBootApplication\npublic class DemoApplication {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);\n    }\n}",
      "language": "java"
    },
    {
      "title": "Understanding Auto Configuration",
      "content": "Auto-configuration is one of Spring Boot’s most powerful features. Based on the dependencies present in the project, Spring Boot automatically configures beans and application settings. This reduces manual configuration and speeds up development while still allowing customization when needed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spring Boot Project Structure",
      "content": "A typical Spring Boot project follows a layered structure with packages such as controller, service, repository, and model. This structure improves maintainability, readability, and scalability by separating concerns and responsibilities within the application."
    },
    {
      "title": "Building a REST Controller",
      "content": "Spring Boot makes it easy to build RESTful APIs using annotations like @RestController and @GetMapping. Controllers handle HTTP requests and return responses in JSON or other formats.",
      "codeExample": "import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;\n\n@RestController\npublic class HelloController {\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/hello\")\n    public String hello() {\n        return \"Hello, Spring Boot!\";\n    }\n}",
      "language": "java"
    },
    {
      "title": "Dependency Injection in Spring Boot",
      "content": "Dependency Injection (DI) allows Spring to manage object creation and dependencies automatically. By using annotations like @Component, @Service, and @Autowired, you can create loosely coupled and testable code."
    },
    {
      "title": "Service Layer in Spring Boot",
      "content": "The service layer contains business logic and acts as an intermediary between controllers and repositories. It helps keep controllers lightweight and promotes clean architecture.",
      "codeExample": "import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;\n\n@Service\npublic class GreetingService {\n    public String greet() {\n        return \"Welcome to Spring Boot\";\n    }\n}",
      "language": "java"
    },
    {
      "title": "Database Integration with Spring Data JPA",
      "content": "Spring Data JPA simplifies database access by reducing boilerplate code. You can define repository interfaces, and Spring automatically provides implementations for common CRUD operations.",
      "codeExample": "import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\n\npublic interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {\n}",
      "language": "java"
    },
    {
      "title": "Application Properties and Configuration",
      "content": "Spring Boot uses application.properties or application.yml files to manage configuration such as server ports, database credentials, and logging levels. Externalized configuration makes applications easier to manage across different environments."
