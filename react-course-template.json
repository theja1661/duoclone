      "title": "What is React?",
      "content": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the UI when data changes using a virtual DOM."
    },
    {
      "title": "Understanding JSX",
      "content": "JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. It makes React components easier to read and write, while still being transformed into regular JavaScript under the hood."

    {
      "title": "Creating Your First React Component",
      "content": "Components are the building blocks of React applications. A component can be a function that returns JSX describing what should appear on the screen.",

      "title": "Props in React",
      "content": "Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They make components reusable and dynamic."

      "title": "Using State with useState Hook",
      "content": "State allows components to manage and store data that can change over time. The useState hook is the most common way to add state to functional components.",

    {
      "title": "Handling Events in React",
      "content": "React handles events similarly to DOM events but uses camelCase syntax. Event handlers are passed as functions and allow you to respond to user actions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rendering Lists in React",
      "content": "You can render lists in React by using JavaScript’s map() method. Each item in a list should have a unique key to help React optimize rendering.",
      "codeExample": "function ListExample() {\n  const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map((item, index) => (\n        <li key={index}>{item}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ListExample;",

      "title": "Conditional Rendering",
      "content": "Conditional rendering allows you to display different UI elements based on certain conditions. This can be done using if statements, ternary operators, or logical && operators."
    },
    {
      "title": "Controlled Components and Forms",
      "content": "In controlled components, form data is handled by React state. This gives you full control over form inputs and makes validation easier.",
      "codeExample": "import { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction LoginForm() {\n  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n    <input\n      type=\"text\"\n      value={username}\n      onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nexport default LoginForm;",
