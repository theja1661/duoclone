      "title": "What is Python?",
      "content": "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It uses clear syntax and English-like keywords, making it an excellent choice for beginners. Python is widely used in web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and many other fields."

    {
      "title": "Python Variables and Data Types",
      "content": "Variables in Python are used to store data values. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to specify the data type explicitly. Common data types include integers, floats, strings, and booleans."

    {
      "title": "Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)",
      "content": "Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on conditions. Python uses indentation instead of braces to define code blocks.",

      "title": "Loops in Python",
      "content": "Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python mainly provides for loops and while loops, which are commonly used for iteration."

    {
      "title": "Using for Loops",
      "content": "The for loop is commonly used to iterate over sequences like lists, strings, or ranges.",

    {
      "title": "Functions in Python",
      "content": "Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help make programs modular and easier to understand.",
      "codeExample": "# Define a function that adds two numbers\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    # Return the sum of a and b\n    return a + b\n\n# Call the function and store the result\nresult = add_numbers(5, 3)\nprint(\"Sum:\", result)",

      "title": "Dictionaries in Python",
      "content": "Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs. They are useful when you want to associate values with unique keys.",
      "codeExample": "# Create a dictionary to store user data\nuser = {\n    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n    \"age\": 25,\n    \"is_active\": True\n}\n\n# Access dictionary values using keys\nprint(\"Name:\", user[\"name\"])\nprint(\"Age:\", user[\"age\"])",
